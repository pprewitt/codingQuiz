# codingQuiz

The assigment was to create a quiz application, which includes:
   
   *automatically loading questions when start button is clicked
   *a timer (which I used as score
   *scorekeeping with initials/clear scores

## Discussion

This one kicked my butt. I am disappointed that I wasnt able to get the timer to continue into the 5th question until the click event. I looked up how to write a conditional that includes a click event and reaching the end of the array, but I wasnt able to find anything that I thought would work. The score keeping was a little tricky, but I got some tips on how to make an object array to contain both initials and score values. Another great learning experience!
